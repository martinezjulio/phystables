Update to the physicsTable package to be more in line with PEP, more flexible,
more documented, etc. Not backwards compatible.

**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Requires the following packages:

* [pymunk v.5.x](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [OptimTools](https://github.com/kasmith/OptimTools)

In addition, [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news) makes visualization easier but is not required
